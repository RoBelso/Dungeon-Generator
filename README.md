# Dungeon-Generator
Yo! I spend the last few days making this dungeon generator in Unity2D! It will generate a bunch of rooms that are all connected to each other, and will lastly generate a boss room at the end. 

I also made some temporary UI and a simple camera script for show, that allows you to play around and interact with the final build

If you press Tab or Enter, you can Toggle between the types of rooms that are allowed to be generated, allowing rooms with 3 openings to occasionally
spawn instead of just rooms with 1 and 2 openings, allowing the map to grow exponentially bigger.

If you press Shift, you can toggle between the way your camera views the map. One just sits in the same place, and the other follows the generation of
the map to include everything in its vision

If you press Space you can regenerate the map after its done generating.

If you press CTRL you can just hide the annoying UI

Lastly, if you press Escape or Delete, you can quit the application

You could download it if you want to use it in some of your projects if you want :)
